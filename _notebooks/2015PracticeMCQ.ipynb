    "I chose option C, but option E was correct because the call Math.random() will produce a double between 0 and 1, not including 1. To generate a random number in the range of 1 to 6, the call Math.random() needs to be multiplied by the number of integers you want to generate, in this case 6, giving us Math.random() * 6. This will result in a double between 0 and 6, not including 6. If we type cast this to an int, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6), the result will be an integer between 0 and 5 inclusive. Adding 1 will adjust the range to 1 to 6 inclusive, as in (int)(Math.random() * 6) + 1. This expression will simulate the rolling of one number cube. Since each roll is independent, to simulate rolling two number cubes, we need to use this expression twice which simplifies to 2 + (int)(Math.random() * 6) + (int)(Math.random() * 6)."

    "I chose option C, but option E was correct because prior to the start of the nested for loops, the value of found is initialized to the element at row 0, column 0 in values and result is initialized to 0.The outer for loop iterates across all rows in values. The inner for loop iterates across the column indices of each row. When an element is located in the two-dimensional array that is larger than the current value stored in found, then this value is assigned to found and the column index is assigned to result. When the nested loop structure stops executing, the largest element in values is stored in found and the column in which that element was located is stored in result."

    "I chose option C, but option E was correct because in condition I, the while loop will not execute, since 1, the value of x, is not less than 0, so nothing will be printed. In condition II, the while loop will execute one time, since 1, the value of x is less than or equal to 1, however, 1 is not even, so nothing will be printed. The value of x will then be incremented to 3, which is not less than or equal to 1, and the loop will terminate. In condition III,  the while loop will execute for x having the value 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. When x becomes 11 the loop will terminate. Even though the loop executes multiple times, the values assigned to x are not even, so nothing is printed."

    "I chose option E, but option A was correct because the outer for loop iterates over every row of numbers and assigns each row to the array row.  The inner loop iterates over the array row accessing each element and assigning it to n. Then n is printed to the screen. In the first iteration of the outer loop, row is equal to {1, 2, 3}, and the inner loop will assign each successive value in row to n and print it to the screen, meaning 123 will be printed. For the second iteration of the outer loop, row is equal to {4, 5, 6}, and the inner loop will assign each successive value in row to n and print it to the screen, meaning 456 will be printed after 123, giving us the output 123456."

    "I chose option B, but option A was correct because each recursive call is made with the value num  / 10. The expression num / 10 uses integer division and evaluates to an integer that is num with the right most digit removed. For example, 258 / 10 = 25. Each time the recursive call is made, what is returned is 1 plus the result of the recursive call. For example, what(258) = 1 + what(25) and what(25) = 1 + what(2) and what(2) = 1. Therefore what(258) = 1 + 1 + 1 or 3, which is the number of digits in 258."

    "I chose option C, but option B was correct because to calculate the average age in a given major, you have to find all the students in the given major, add up their ages, and divide by the total number of students in the major. Since theMajor is a String, the if statement needs to use .equals to compare theMajor with the major of k, found by calling the getMajor() method on k. If this boolean expression is true, we need to add the age of k, found by calling the getAge() method on k to sum and increase count by 1."
