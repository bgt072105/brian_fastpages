# Unit One: Primitive Types
Goal: To learn the fundamentals of Java and other foundational concepts for coding.



# Unit Two: Using Objects
Goal: Explore reference data in order to represent real-world objects in a digital world and discover methods to initiate more complex operations

# Unit Three: Boolean Expressions and if Statements
Goal: Dive into the building blocks of algorithms and use conditional statements to solve problems and have control over your results

# Unit Four: Iteration
Goal: Learn about iteration which is used for repetition in algorithms

# Unit Five: Writing Clauses
Goal: Explore real-world interactions that can be expressed through code by organizing behaviors and attribites into classes -- also learn about the legal and ethical implications of programming

# Unit Six: Array
Goal: Learn techniques and standard algorithms to work with collections of data structures

# Unit Seven: ArrayList
Goal: Delve into data setts, exploring ArrayList objects for larger amounts of data, as well as the privacy concerns for your personal data storage

# Unit Eight: 2D Array
Goal: Experiment with data sets represented in a table

# Unit Nine: Inheritance
Goal: Manipulate programming without altering original code by using subclasses to create a hierarchy

# Unit Ten: Recurision
Goal: Solve larger problems by solving small versions of the same problems using recursive methods
