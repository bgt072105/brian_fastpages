    "* Object\n",
    "    * instance of a class\n",
    "* Class\n",
    "    * defines an abstract type\n",
    "* Methods\n",
    "    * behaviors you can get the object to do\n",
    "* Constructors\n",
    "    * creates the object\n",
    "    * special method for object instantiation\n",
    "    * default constructor has no arguments\n",
    "* Main method\n",
    "    * test the class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessor Methods\n",
    "* Get of methods or getters\n",
    "    * allows you to get values of variables\n",

    "### Public, Private, Protected\n",
    "* Public - can be accessed within and outside of class\n",
    "* Private - can only be accessed within the class\n",
    "* Protected - can be accessed by all classes in the package and all subclass outside of the package\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance, extends\n",
    "* Inheritance is a way for attributes and methods to be inherited from one class to another\n",
    "* Extends is what allows you to bring those attributes from one class to another\n",

    "### Subclass constructor, super Keyword\n",
    "* A subclass inherits all the members from the superclass while the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass\n",

    "### Overloading a method, same name different parameters\n",
    "* Overloading a method in java is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, but with different parameters\n",
    "* Instead of defining two methods that do the same thing, it is better to overload one\n",

    "### Overriding a method, same signature of a method\n",

    "* When a subclass provides a particular implementation of a method declared by one of its parent classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract Class, Abstract Method\n",

    "* An abstract method is a method that has just the method definition but does not contain implementation\n",

    "### Standard methods: toString(), equals(), hashCode()\n",
    "* Standard methods are blocks of code that can be called from another location in the program or class\n",
    "* toString(); returns the given value in string format\n",
    "* equals(); compares two strings and returns true if the strings are equal\n",
