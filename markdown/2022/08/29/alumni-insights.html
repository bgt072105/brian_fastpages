<p>My biggest takeaway from today’s alumni Q&amp;A session has been the sheer usefulness
of computer science and its far reaching practical use potential. Specifically, many of
the alumni who spoke today mentioned that they were not strictly majoring in computer
science. Many of them were majoring in other STEM fields such as mechanical engineering,
aerospace engineering, cognitive science, or others. However, in every case the alumni
really emphasized how despite the fact that their major isn’t specifically in computer
science, they manage to use computer science in their major. Learning this really made
me realize the practicality of learning foundations of computer science. In an increasingly
technology driven world, computer science has begun to make its impact on all sorts of
other fields of study. For example, one of the alumni discussed how they had been using
skills they learned in computer science in order to analyze flight data at Northrop
Grumman. Despite not majoring in computer science, this alumni’s computer science skills
allowed them to access opportunities that would have otherwise likely been unattainable.
This is just one of many examples of the practical use cases of computer science that
go beyond just majoring in computer science. Thus, it is critical for people to develop
foundational skills in computer science in our technology driven society.</p>

<p>Another key takeaway that I got from today’s alumni Q&amp;A session has been just how
important APCSP and APCSA are for developing foundational computer science skills. I have
managed to develop a newfound appreciation for the skills that I have learned and
developed over my experience in both APCSP and APCSA thus far. Many of the alumni had
discussed how they viewed APCSP and APCSA as a gateway for them into the world of
computer science. Now that I am taking the time to reflect on my own experience in APCSP
and APCSA thus far, I can safely say that I feel the same way about these courses
being instrumental to developing the fundamentals of computer science. I believe that
these classes have taught me the core understandings and skills of computer science
that I will need in order to pursue computer science at a higher level. Tying back
into the fact that the applications of computer science are becoming increasingly
diverse, it only seems natural for me to work on developing my key understandings of
computer science so that I can eventually apply my knowledge to real world scenarios.</p>
